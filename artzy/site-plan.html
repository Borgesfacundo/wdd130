      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My personal website will help people to get a cheap and nice website for their business. No matter if it’s a big or small business, I'm ready to bring my knowledge to help people to design their websites. Here they will find some good ideas and information about website designs.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>I will focus my attention on all kinds of businesses in the town, no matter if they are small or big. I know that a website can help any kind of business to grow and expand. If you have a big business without a website you will be losing some clients that they prefer to buy online. Same if you have a small business there is no better way to grow up than creating a website.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        One of the most important things that you need to know are the color that you want to use. They need to Look good together and you need to be sure that the website will be readable.
        
        A color palette, in the digital world, refers to the full range of colors that can be displayed on a device screen or other interface, or in some cases, a collection of colors and tools for use in paint and illustration programs. The color palette reveals a lot about the electronic design of the device or technology and its visual capabilities for human users. A color palette is also known simply as a palette.

        Another Important tip that we want to give you is about the images that will follow the text.
        
        Try to use images that will be directly related to the content that people will be reading on your website. Try to use images with colors that will look good with the website colors. But don’t worry if it is a little hard to understand. We are always ready to help you and advise you if something needs to be changed or modified.
